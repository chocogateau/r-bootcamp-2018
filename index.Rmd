## About this course

R is one of the core languages in data science. It's free and fun to use. 
Join us in learning how to use this tool to accelerate your research.

The course *heavily* emphasizes the use of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't have to use RStudio to use R, but we think that doing so makes R an even more powerful tool.
Plus, RStudio has fully featured free versions, including some available entirely in your web browser.

### What to bring

**Note**: If possible, please bring a laptop.
Please make sure you complete the mandatory steps outlined [here](before-the-bootcamp.html) to ensure that your computer can connect to the Penn State wifi.
If you want to run RStudio in a web browser, then follow [these](rstudio-tlt.html) instructions.
Or (or in addition) you may want to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
We will be walking through a number of demonstrations during the course and it may be useful to follow along on your own machine.
