Welcome to the R Bootcamp for PSU Psychology researchers. The goal of this two-day workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the use of the R programming language for social science research. Participants are not expected to have prior experience with R or another programming language. The scope and schedule of the course is provided [here](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp/schedule.html).

## About this course

R is one of the core languages in data science. It's free and fun to use. 
Join us in learning how to use this tool to accelerate your research.

The course *heavily* emphasizes the use of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't have to use RStudio to use R, but we think that doing so makes R an even more powerful tool.
Plus, RStudio has fully featured free versions, including some available entirely in your web browser.

### What to bring

**Note**: If possible, please bring a laptop, preferably with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) already installed. We will be walking through a number of demonstrations during the course and it may be useful to follow along on your own machine.
