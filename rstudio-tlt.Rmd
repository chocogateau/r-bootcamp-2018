4. Enter your PSU access ID (e.g., rog1) in the `Username` field (Do **not** add `@psu.edu`), and enter your PSU password in the `Password` field. 
    - The use of a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, or DashLane is highly recommended.

5. Hit the `Sign In` button or press return on your keyboard.
    - You should see an RStudio window that looks very much like this one.
