## Slow Track

- What is R?
    - A programming language
        - People telling computers what to do and how
    - Why is it called R?
        - TLDR: it's the free, open-source version of a commercial program called S.
        - Software developers have an unusual sense of humor.
- Why should I learn R?
    - It's fun
    - It's free
    - You can amaze your friends and dazzle your foes
    - It's powerful, especially for manipulating, plotting, and analyzing data
    - **It will make you a more productive researcher**
- What about learning other languages?
    - Go for it!
        - But make sure you develop some mastery over one computer language before learning another one
    - Other useful languages to learn: Python, Matlab, *nix shell programming, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL
- Your turn
    - Why do *you* want to learn R?
    - What specifically do you want to know or do?
    - What are your concerns?
- The road ahead
    - Like any skill, programming requires (regular, spaced) practice
    - There will be pain and frustration
    - Persist
    - Computers are dumber than you imagine, but they're super-fast and they don't complain about repetitive tasks
- Talking to the computer
    - RStudio
        - Discuss components/panes/windows later
    - The command line or console
        - The prompt and cursor
            - One way to talk to the computer
            - Interactive
                - We type, it responds
                - Or really, we command, it responds (if it can)
            - Old school: Goes back to the 60s
            - Seems less powerful than...Siri or Alexa or...
                - But wait and see
        - What's happening under the hood?
            - R is waiting for you to do something (hit the `return` key)
            - When you hit `return`, tries to 'understand' what you typed
                - By 'understand' we mean...
            - Computers don't get impatient...really
        - Let's try
            - Typing `hi` results in `Error: object 'hi' not found`
            - Notice R doesn't really understand English
            - Type "help"
                - RStudio tries to 'help' you by adding '()', but delete those for now and just type 'help'
                - Those are the sequence of things that R does under the hood when you issue the `help` command.
                - So R understands some things, but not others
            - Type `help()`
                - This opens a new window in RStudio's "Help" panel.
                - This is the documentation about how to ask R for help.
                - The `()` parentheses after the word 'help' are where you give R more information about what and how you want it to carry out your command.
                    - These are called 'arguments' or 'parameters'
                    - `help()` is a function, and the information you type in the parentheses are the arguments or parameters for the function.
          - Functions are sets of commands, like recipes
              - Imagine if your kitchen had a command line
              - Imagine issuing a `bake_cake(kind = 'chocolate', layers = 3, size = 'big')` command
              - Try it in R
              - Too bad, R `could not find function "bake_cake"`
              - Just for fun: Design your own function with 2 or 3 arguments
          - Functions R **does** understand
              - Try `sum(2,3,4)`
              - Try `cos(pi)`
              - Try `1:5`
              - Try `mean(1:5)`
              - Try `print("Hello, world")`
        - Types of things R understands
            - Numbers, strings (combinations of letters, numbers and characters), commands
            - Enter numbers like you'd type them: `1` or `3.14`
            - Enter strings surrounded by single or double quotes: "R", or "version.1"
                - `sqrt(9)` vs. `sqrt('9')` or `sqrt("9")`
        - Getting really anal
            - **Use underscores "_" rather than spaces**. Just do it.
                - Why: R treats strings connected by underscores as one thing.
                - `my_really_big_string`
            - **Name things with letters, numbers, and underscores**.
        - Naming things
            - `my_age <- 55`
            - Use the `<-` combination to assign names `my_age` to values `55`.
                - Type `<` and then `-`or just `option + -` (Mac) or `alt + -` (Windows)
                - `<-` is called an assignment operator.
                - `<-` tells R to 'assign' the name on the left to the thing on the right.
                - We'll use `<-` a lot.
                - Now, R knows (for now) that when I type `my_age` I want it to substitute the value `55`. This will come in handy.
            - **Don't use `=`. You can, but don't**. It's like saying 'like' all the time. Like people will like understand you, but they'll wonder why you like say like all the time when you really need not. It's also a topic that will get you in a 'flame war'. **Avoid flame wars**.
        - R as a calculator
            - Try entering `2 + 2` and `1/sqrt(99)`
            - `height_ft <- 6`
            - `shoe_size <- 9`
            - `(1/sin(height_ft))*sqrt(shoe_size)`
            - **Use human-readable and meaningful names for things**. Be kind to your future self.
        - Summing up: Talking to R at the command line or console
            - Command R to do something (it already knows how to do)
                - `mean(1:436)`
            - Command R to do something and name the result
                - `half_way_to_436 <- mean(1:436)`
            - Ask R for help
                - `help("mean")`
            - Tell R what to do when we command it (create a function)
                - `add_13 <- function(number){number + 13}`
                - `add_one(15.333)`
                - `add_one("15.333")`
                    - `Error in number * 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator`
                    - This function can't add (`+`) strings (non-numeric arguments)
        - Your questions
        - Some elaborations before we move on
            - Command history tab
                - All the commands you've issued (but not the results)
            - Environment tab
                - What names you've assigned to things (not the names R already knows)
