## Introduction to joining datasets using dplyr

This document is a minor adaptation of Michael Hallquist's minor adaptation of Jenny Bryan's `dplyr` joins tutorial (with a little help from animations by Garrick Aden-Buie): <http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html>. The goal is to develop an intuition of the four major types of two-table join operations: inner, left, right, and full.  We'll also get into using joins to identify areas of match or mismatch between two datasets (using semi- and anti-joins).

First, we import the data into data.frame objects. We're generating the data from scratch using character strings. But the join functions below will work with other data types (e.g., numeric data).

```{r}

superheroes <-"
name,     alignment, gender, publisher
Magneto,  bad,       male,   Marvel
Storm,    good,      female, Marvel
Mystique, bad,       female, Marvel
Batman,   good,      male,   DC
Joker,    bad,       male,   DC
Catwoman, bad,       female, DC
Hellboy,  good,      male,   Dark Horse Comics
"


superheroes <- read_csv(superheroes, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1) #"trim_ws" eliminates extra spaces in dataset; #skip=1 tells R not to read in the first line of data as data (instead leaving it as column names) 

publishers <- "
publisher, yr_founded
DC,        1934
Marvel,    1939
Image,     1992
"
publishers <- read_csv(publishers, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)

superheroes
publishers

```

## Mutating joins: inner, left, right, full

"Mutating" joins combine variables from two datasets on the basis of one or more keys that match between datasets.  In the case of these datasets, notice they share the "publisher" column.

*NB*: By default, `dplyr` will search for common columns across datsets as the matching
keys (natural join). If you want to control the process, specify the key using "by".

###inner join
Require match in both datasets (non-matching rows are dropped)

For those of you who are visual learners, conceptually, imagine the following two simple datasets:

An **inner join** combines the two datasets and drops the non-matching rows like so: 

![](../img/inner-join.gif)

Lets try it with our superhero data.
```{r}
(ijsp <- inner_join(x=superheroes, y=publishers)) #*NB*: the extra parentheses enclosing the line of code tell R to both save the new dataframe as ijsp AND to print the result simultaneously

```

Same idea, just explicit declaration of key (i.e., "publisher")
```{r}
inner_join(superheroes, publishers, by="publisher") #note that we've cut the x=, y= as this isn't necessary to specify
```
Notice both Hellboy (from the *superheroes* dataset) and Image comics (from the *publishers* dataset) were dropped. 


###left join
Keep all rows in left-hand 'x' dataset (i.e., superheroes). Add columns from publishers where
there is a match. Fill in NA for non-matching observations.

![](../img/left-join.gif)

```{r}
(ljsp <- left_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

###right join
Keep all rows in right-hand 'y' dataset (i.e., publishers). Add columns from superheroes where
there is a match. Fill in NA for non-matching observations.

![](../img/right-join.gif)

```{r}
(superheroes %>% right_join(publishers)->rjsp) #note the shift to using dplyr piping; just another way to do this code
```

###full join
Keep all rows in left-hand 'x' (superheroes) and right-hand 'y' (publishers) datasets. 
Resulting dataset will have all columns of both datasets, but filling in
NA for any non-matches on either side (denoted as blank spaces below).

![](../img/full-join.gif)

```{r}
(superheroes %>% full_join(publishers)->fjsp)
```

##One-to-many join
Note that when there are non-unique matches, the join adds all possible combinations.
This occurs in a one-to-many join.

![](../img/left-join-extra.gif)

Let's say you wanted to see if students' final grades were associated with how many extra credit points they recieved on multiple assignments during a course. 

```{r}
(extra_credit <- data_frame(x = c("Jeff", "Karla", "Jasmine", "Karla"), z = c(2, 5, 4, 4)))
(final_grade <- data_frame(x = c("Jeff", "Karla", "Ping"), y = c(70, 80, 92)))


final_grade %>% left_join(extra_credit)
```

##Filtering joins: semi_join and anti_join
Filtering joins use specific criteria to identify observations (rows) from one table that exist or don't exist in another table.

These joins are typically used for diagnosing mismatch between two overlapping datasets.

###semi_join
retain observations (rows) in x that match in y

![](../img/semi-join.gif)

Notice that this is different from the left_join shown above as the data from y is *not* kept.

```{r}
semi_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

Now, observations in publishers that match in superheroes
```{r}
semi_join(publishers, superheroes)
```

This can be useful if you have a dataset of your data of interest and another dataset that indicates which of your participants/observations you want to remove or filter out. 

###anti_join
observations in x that are *not* matched in y
Note that this is similar to `setdiff` in base R

![](../img/anti-join.gif)

Observations in superheroes that don't match in publishers
```{r}
anti_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

Now, observations in publishers that don't match in superheroes
```{r}
publishers %>% anti_join(superheroes)
```

This can be useful if you are trying to identify extra participants/observations that may have snuck into one dataset (x) or been deleted in another (y).

##Joining multiple datasets

Joining can be done repeatedly across multiple datasets.  The following code, for instance, joins datasets two at a time from left to right in the list. The result of a two-table join becomes the 'x' dataset for the next join of a new dataset 'y'.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(id=1:10, x=rnorm(10), y=runif(10))
df2 <- data.frame(id=1:11, z=rnorm(11), a=runif(11))
df3 <- data.frame(id=2:10, b=rnorm(9), c=runif(9))

dftemp<-full_join(df1,df2)
dffinal<-full_join(dftemp,df3)

#alternative way to combine:
Reduce(function(...) { full_join(...) }, list(df1, df2, df3))
```

Alternative using pipeline (less extensible)
```{r}
(mergedf = df1 %>% full_join(df2) %>% full_join(df3))
```
