## Aspirations & Philosophy

- You **can** learn to program
- You **should** learn to program
- R is a good language for learning programming
- "Do or do not; there is no try" (Yoda)

## Some background

- About computers
- The storRy of R

## About computers
    
- Computers store data & instructions (programs, scripts etc.)
    - Short-term (during your work session) in volatile memory
    - Long-term (between work sessions) in files
    
---
    
```{r}
# List the files in my current directory
dir()
```

## About computers
    
- Files are organised in directories (folders)
    - Directories/folders have a hierarchy
    - The set of directories to a file is called the path

```{r}
# Get and print the current working directory
getwd()
```

    - TLDR: it's the free, open-source version of a commercial program called S developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs
    - Bell Labs is also the home of C, and the Unix operating system
    
## The storRy of R

- Features of R
    - Written in C, Fortran, and R
    - 14th most [popular programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
    - Base R (now 3.5.1) + thousands of packages
    - Object-oriented
    
## Using R

- On your own computer
- In the cloud from your browser
