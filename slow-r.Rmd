## The slow-R tutorial

> We're not slow; we're not fast. We're half-fast. 

(Joke my Dad didn't think I got as a kid.)

This tutorial is intended as a very slow introduction to using R.
If we're going too slow for you, that's ok.
But if we're going too fast, please say so!
We think that by going slow at the start, it will be easier to speed up later.

## Talking to the computer

We talk about programming a computer or coding, but most of the time we're having a conversation.
We say something, and the computer responds.
We say something else, and the computer responds.
And so on.

In this section, we'll learn how to talk to the computer in a language it understands.
That language is R.

### Why learn R?

It's fun.
It's free
You can amaze your friends and dazzle your rivals.
It's powerful, especially for manipulating, plotting, and analyzing data.

**It will make you a more productive researcher.**
That's the bottom line.

> What if you want to learn another programming language?

Awesome! 
Good for you. 
Learn a bunch of languages.
They're a bit like human languages: It's easier or more poetic to say some things in some languages than it is in others.
But make sure you develop some mastery over one computer language before learning another one.
Other useful languages to learn include the following: Python, Matlab, *nix shell programming, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, C/C++, Java.

### Open RStudio

[RStudio](http://rstudio.com) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
RStudio brings together a number of useful tools for talking to the computer in R.
You don't have to use RStudio, but you should use it for this bootcamp, and we strongly recommend using it in the future.

I'm going to login to a version of RStudio that Penn State hosts so that Penn Staters can use RStudio from a web browser.
I enter [https://lxclusterapps.tlt.psu.edu:8788](https://lxclusterapps.tlt.psu.edu:8788) in my browser, enter my PSU Access ID (rog1) and password, then click on the the `Sign In` button with my mouse or press return on my keyboard.
Then I see an RStudio window that looks very much like this one:

<img src="img/rstudio-server-startup.jpg"/>

This is the default view.
It has several different "windows" or panels.
They each provide us with helpful information.
You can rearrange them or customize RStudio to your heart's content.
But do that later.
For now, let's concentrate on the panel on the left side called the `Console`.

### Console

The console is where you do most of your talking to R.
Notice that there is some text, and then a greater-than sign (`>`) sign.
Let's read the text.

Besides the version of R and some other details, it tells us how to start a conversation with R.
It says `Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.`
Let's try that.
Type 'license()' right after the greater-than `> ` sign.
Press the `return` or `enter` key on your keyboard to tell R you've finished saying something.

```{r}
'license()'
```

<img src="img/type-license.jpg"/>

Well, that wasn't very interesting.
The computer responded by repeating what we'd typed, changing the single quotation marks for double quotation marks, but that's about it.

> Painful lesson #1: Computers are super-literal. They are anally literal. You're not going to change them. Just deal.

Try typing `license()` without the single quotation marks (and hit return/enter).

```{r}
license()
```

<img src="img/better-license.jpg"/>

Much better!
So, this was our first 'conversation' with the computer.
We said something in R, and the computer responded.

Why did typing `license()` work but typing `'license()'` not work?
The single quotation marks.
Typing `license()` without them gave R a command; surrounding the same characters with single quotation marks told R that all of those characters were a single unit called a string, *not* a command.
As I said, computers are *very* literal.
Many of the errors and frustrations you will encounter in your R journey will come down to your not telling the computer what to do in EXACTLY the way it needs to be told.

#### Parts of the console

The console refers to the whole window or panel.
Notice that as we type text or R does, that text scrolls up so we can see the recent history of our conversation.
You can scroll (with your mouse or arrow keys) up and down in the console.

The greater-than (`> `) character is called the 'prompt', and the vertical line or pipe character (`|`) is called the 'cursor'. 
You already knew about the cursor.
It's where characters we type will be entered.
The prompt is just a character to 'prompt' or remind us that R is waiting for us to say something.

#### Interacting with R via the console

Typing in the console is just one way to talk to the computer.
It's *interactive*, meaning we type, it responds.
Or really, we command, it responds (if it can).
This way of talking to computers is very old school.
It goes back to the 60s.
It might seems less powerful than say clicking buttons or menu items or talking to Siri or Alexa.
But just wait and see.
The console is our window into the computer's brain.

What's happening under the hood here?
When the console displays the prompt it means that R is waiting for you to do something.
That something is to type something and hit the `return` key.
When you hit `return`, R tries to 'understand' what you typed and do something sensible in response.

> Complex programs are just long sequences of commands entered into something like the computer's console and the computer's responses to those commands.

### Talking to R

So, what can you say to R?
You can give R commands and ask it simple questions.
That's pretty much it.

When you type things that end with parentheses like `license()`, that commands R to do something, in this case, to 'print the license information'.
Why doesn't R require you to say `print_license()`?
To save typing.

Here's another command: `sum(1, 4, 7)`
```{r}
sum(1, 4, 7)
```
This command says 'calculate and print the sum of the numbers 1, 4, and 7'.
R responds with the answer: 12.
Notice that there are two parts to the command: the 'what to do' part (`sum`) and the 'what to do it with or on' part inside the parentheses, here `(1,4,7)`.
We'll return to this later, but many, many things we want to do or say in life (and R life) have two parts, the 'verb' or action we want to do and the 'noun' or objects/people we want to involve in that action.
The parentheses tell R which is which when it reads the command from the console.

Here's another useful command: `my_age <- 55`
```{r}
my_age <- 55 # Rick's age
# Text that is preceded by the # character is called a comment.
# These are 'notes' you can keep about your code so you remember why you
# did something. Here, R ignores the part after the #: ' Rick's age'
```
This command tells R to 'assign the name "my_age" to the number 55'.
The 'assign the name' command is the combination is that backwards arrow `<-` symbol.
You can type it the easy way by typing `option` and the minus `-` keys at the same time (Mac OS) or the `alt` and `-` keys on Windows.
You can also type it the hard way by typing a `<` and then `-`.
But train your fingers to type it the easy way.

#### (Optional) sidebar comment

Why does R have two different ways of accepting commands, one that uses parentheses like `do_something()` and one specific for the 'assign the name' command?
Because the 'assign the name' command is very similar to what you learned in algebra class when you were told you could give names to numbers, like $a=1$.
R's syntax assigns to the value (on the right side) the name (on the left).
So, really, R is doing something like `assign('my_age', 55)` when you type `my_age <- 55`.
In fact, they're the same thing.
Try it.
```{r}
assign('my_age', 55)
my_age   # Tells R to print the current value assigned to 'my_age'
your_age <- 25
your_age # Print the value assigned to 'your_age' 
```
So, if you want to be consistent in commanding R, you can always use the `command()` syntax.
And by the way, this works, too:

```
`->`('your_age', 25) # Wonky way to show that the assignment operator is a command
```

By the way, R accepts the equal sign `=` character to assign names (on the left) to values (on the right), just like the convention in math.
**Don't use `=`. You can, but don't. Use `<-`**. 
It's like saying 'like' all the time. Like people will like understand you, but they'll wonder why you like say like all the time when you really need not. It's also a topic that will get you in a 'flame war'. 
**Avoid flame wars**.

#### Asking questions

We can also ask R questions.
By typing comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.) we can ask R true/false questions.
```{r}
1 == 0
sqrt(9) < 4
'rick' == 'rick'
'richard' > 'rick'
'richard' != 'rick'
```
R will respond with `TRUE` or `FALSE` to these questions.
Notice that `==` asks if the two things are equal and `!=` asks if they are unequal.
This is different from what you learned in math class, where $a=1$ could be either a statement (or assignment command) or a question.
If computers had invented math, rather than the reverse, they would have separated making statements or commands from asking questions--for clarity.

If you want to think of this in a "commanding" way, you could say that you are commanding R to 'compare these two things and print TRUE or FALSE depending on the outcome of the comparison'.

#### Rules for naming things

R has rules for names.
You'll be fine if you 1) replace spaces with underscores (`_`), and 2) start names with letters, not numbers.
So, `good_name`, `a_longer_good_name`, and `Good_name1`, but not `bad name` or `1_very_bad_name`.
There are other rules and exceptions, but this is a good place to start.

#### What can we talk about?

You may be unimpressed with our conversations with R, at least so far.
But let's recap.

We can talk about numbers: `75` or `4^2` (4 to the 2nd power) or `3.14159`.
Notice that we type numbers 'in the nude' or without surrounding them with quotation marks.
We *can* surround numbers with parentheses, though: `(75) == 75`.
Here, parentheses function just like they do in math, so $(10-8)+1$ is equal to three:
```{r}
(10-8)+1 == 3
```
So, R is a very big pocket calculator.

We can also talk about strings, or sets of letters, numbers, and characters: `'Fourscore and seven years ago'` or `'RStudio'` or `'R 3.5'`.
Unlike names, strings *can* have spaces (and special characters like $ or !) in them or start with numbers--as long as the string starts and ends with quotation marks.
The quotation marks tell R where the string starts and where it ends.
```{r}
my_name <- 'Rick'
my_quest <- 'The Holy Grail'
favorite_color <- 'Blue, no green'
```
R treats strings and numbers as different beasts, so `1 == '1'` is `FALSE`.
```{r}
1 == '1'      # Compare the number 1 to the string '1'
'one' == '1'
'one' < 'two' # Be careful! R is not comparing the numbers but each letter
```

We can also talk about *commands*, so `help('sum')` gives us helpful information about the `sum()` command.
```{r}
help('sum')
```
Notice that we have to put the name of the command in quotation marks.
That tells R that we are talking about the command 'sum' not giving R the command to sum something.

> You can use either single or double quotation marks for strings, but I recommend using single ones. And don't mix and match: `'R will hate this"`

### Summing up

These are the basic building blocks:

- We type commands or questions into the Console, and R does our bidding...as long as we follow the rules that R requires for us to understand one another.
- We can talk about numbers, strings, and commands.

And very soon, we'll see how we can talk about collections of numbers and strings (e.g., data) and sequences of commands (scripts or programs).
