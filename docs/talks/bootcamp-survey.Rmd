# Goals

- Download and clean data from 2018 R Bootcamp Survey
- Visualize data

# Preliminaries

Load required packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets)
```

# Load data and examine

The survey data are stored in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YB0iWUNN_9oxBhz221NFiyBOcwMfHziFeUiUvQwn7k/edit#gid=2108979913). 
We'll use the `googlesheets` package to open it and create a data frame. Documentation about the package can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/basic-usage.html).

There are some idiosyncrasies in using the `googlesheets` package in an R Markdown document because it requires interaction with the console, so I created a separate R script, `Get_bootcamp_googlesheet.R` to extract the survey data.
If you try to execute the next chunk, it may give you an error, or it may ask you to allow `googlesheets` to access information in your Google profile.
This just allows R to grab the data from the Googlesheet using your Google account.

```
survey_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YB0iWUNN_9oxBhz221NFiyBOcwMfHziFeUiUvQwn7k/edit?usp=sharing"

bootcamp_by_url <- gs_url(survey_url)

bootcamp_sheets <- gs_ws_ls(bootcamp_by_url)

boot_data <- bootcamp_by_url %>%
  gs_read(bootcamp_sheets[1])
          
write_csv(boot_data, path=params$data_file_out)
```

This script downloads the data file saves it to a CSV under `r params$data_file_out`.
We can then load this file.

I also created a test data file, `data/survey-test.csv` so I could see how everything worked before y'all filled out your responses.
The [`R/Make_test_survey.R`](../R/Make_test_survey.R) file shows how I did this.
It's a great, reproducible practice to **simulate the data you expect**, then run it through your pipeline.

---

```{r load-data}
# Choose data from respondents
survey <- read_csv(params$data_file_in)
```

```{r}
survey
```

The `str()` or 'structure' command is also a great way to see what you've got.

```{r}
str(survey)
```

Clearly, we need to do some cleaning before we can do anything with this.

## Cleaning data

Let's start by renaming variables.

```{r rename-vars}
names(survey) <- c("Timestamp",
                  "R_exp",
                  "Banjo",
                  "Psych_age_yrs",
                  "Sleep_hrs",
                  "Fav_day",
                  "Crisis")
```


```{r clean-survey}
# complete.cases() drops NAs
survey <- survey[complete.cases(survey),]
survey
```

Now, lets make sure we have numbers where we expect them. 
<!-- That person who really likes 8 hours ("8!!!") is a problem (for me, not them). -->

```{r make-numbers}
survey$Sleep_hrs <- readr::parse_number(survey$Sleep_hrs)
survey
```

Looks good. Let's save that cleaned file so we don't have to do this again.

```{r }
write_csv(survey, path="../data/survey_clean.csv")
```

We may want to make the `R_exp` variable ordered.

```{r modify-r-exp}
(survey_responses <- unique(survey$R_exp))
```

This shows us the different survey response values.
It looks like somebody checked all the levels.
Let's change that to limited.

```{r}
survey$R_exp[survey$R_exp == "none, limited, lots, pro"] <- "limited"
```


```{r}
survey$R_exp <- ordered(survey$R_exp, levels=c("none",
                                               "limited",
                                               "some",
                                               "lots",
                                               "pro"))
```

# Visualization

Now, we follow Mike Meyer's advice: "Plot your data!"

## Descriptive plots

```{r R-exp-hist, fig.cap="Distribution of prior R experience"}
R_exp_hist <- survey %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=R_exp) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count") # R_exp is discrete
R_exp_hist
```

```{r Sleep_hrs_hist, fig.cap="Distribution of preferred sleep hrs/day"}
Sleep_hrs_hist <- survey %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=Sleep_hrs) +
  geom_histogram() # Sleep_hrs is continuous
Sleep_hrs_hist
```

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of Enthusiasm for Banjo Music"}
Banjo_hist <- survey %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=Banjo) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
Banjo_hist
```

---

Does R experience have any relation to banjo music enthusiasm or one's psychological age?

```{r Banjo-vs-r-exp}
Banjo_vs_r_exp <- survey %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=Banjo, y=Psych_age_yrs) +
  facet_grid(. ~ R_exp) +
  geom_point()
  # + stat_smooth()
Banjo_vs_r_exp
```

```{r Crisis, cache=TRUE}
crisis_plot <- survey %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=Crisis) +
  geom_bar()
crisis_plot
```

# Data documentation (codebook)

Every data set should be documented.
You can generate a template data codebook with some useful summary information using the package `dataMaid`.

```{r make_dataMaid_codebook}
if(!require(dataMaid)){install.packages('dataMaid')}
library(dataMaid)
dataMaid::makeCodebook(data = survey, 
                       reportTitle = 'Codebook for 2018 R bootcamp survey', 
                       replace = TRUE)
```

Then, we can look at the `codebook_survey.Rmd` file and edit it as needed, especially the section with the code descriptions.

```

# Analysis

I could use a document like this to plan out my analysis plan **before** I conduct it.
If I used simulated data, I could make sure that my workflow will run when I get real (cleaned) data.
I could even preregister my analysis plan before I conduct it.
That doesn't preclude later exploratory analyses, but it does hold me and my collaborators accountable for what I predicted in advance.

# Notes

Notice that I sometimes put a label like `Banjo-vs-r-exp` in the brackets `{}`for a given 'chunk' of R code. The main reasons to do this are:

- It sometimes makes it easier to debug your code.
- In some cases, you can have this 'chunk' name serve as the file name for a figure you generate within a chunk.
- In a bit, we'll see how these chunk names are useful for making tables, figures, and equations that generate their own numbers.
